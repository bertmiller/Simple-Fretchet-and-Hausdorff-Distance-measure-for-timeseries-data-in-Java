# Simple-Fretchet-and-Hausdorff-Distance-measure-for-timeseries-data-in-Java

There were no good tools for this online so I decided to create them.  The reason I needed these functions was to use them with timeseries data and these functions reflect that.  It should be fairly straight forward to make these functions more dynamic to process traditional data structured in cartisan coordinates and if you need help with that then drop me a line.  

A simple use case has been proved in the main class.
